# axis-ming-path

A tool to analyze how objects moves within a scene.  The data is captured by an ACAP called Path that is installed in Axis cameras.  The data is sent over MQTT to an MQTT broker hosted within the tool.  The data is stored in an InfluxDB and a MongoDB also hosted within the toool.

The container includes:
* Node-RED, flows and modules
* Mosquitto MQTT Broker
* Mongo DB
* Influx DB
* Grafan can be easily added by editing the docker-compose.yaml
